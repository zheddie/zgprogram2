# 1.oftxfer tool.
"oftfer -prompt"
This command prompt the oftfer GUI panel. Then user can use it to list files and send them to an i box.
"oftxfer -system javap5 -sbpbuildid <builder> -logon xj9 -file `pwd`/888.oft"
This command is used for sending one file to an i box(here is javap5).
Note:
1. user have to input the full path of the file want to be sent.
2. oftxfer is used for process oft files and oft files are created after compiler on the AFS(or on AIX). So you can find oft files in "gen" path and we usually do this command in "gen" side.
"oftxfer -system javap5 -sbpbuildid <builderid> -logon xj9 -o `pwd`/filelist‚Äù

This command is used for sending files listed in filelist to an i box(here is javap5).

oftxfer -fi qp2cl.qwobj.oft -l zhanggan -sbpb zgid -system ut28p65 

Note:
oft
## 1.user have to creat the filelist file before using it. e.g. "find `pwd` -name \*.oft", the different is in the output of these two command.
## 2. <builderid>: builder ID is an object that used for building oftxfer transfered files on i. On i, all the build tools are stored in the three librarys:qdevelop, qbldsys,qbldsysr. .
WRKBLDID: work with all builder IDs on i.
ADDBUILDER : add builder ID on i. You have to add a builder id before using it in oftxfer command. Following is command we use to add builder id for j9
ADDBUILDER BLDID(XJ92) BLDRTYPE(*MINI) DESTOPT(*SYSTEM) IMPTDATE(*ANY) DEBUG(*NO)
or DEBUG(*YES) ====>This will fix the issue of 020A about the optimization error.
<meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"> REPBPR: used for rebuilding all objectS in one builder ID. After rebuilding, level of the rebuilt object are change to 1.
3. Before using build tools, you have to run CRTBLDEVT on i to prepare environment for build tools. This command only need to be run once after system installation.

2. obi files summary:
1.obi files are configuration files. They are used when we compile codes on AFS. From these files, compiler find information like:
which source file to compile, what kind of object the file should be compile to, where to store the final built object on i.
2. pattern of all kinds of obi files
XXXX.ifsfile.obi: This means the final object is a IFS object and it will store in IFS system on i.
XXXXXX.module.obi: This means the final object is a module on i. Final object can be .qwobj. or .srvpgm.
XXXXXX.srvpgm.obi:This means the final object is a *SRVPGM on i. This build normally depends on multiple modules.
XX.prdlod.obi: This means the final object is a product load definition object, e.g. qjva1150.prdloa.obj. For qjva1150, 11 means product option is 11, 50=MRM means code(MRI means information need to be tranlate to mutiple languages).
XXX.lib.obi: This means the final object is a lib on i.

3. The error of 020A if no DEBUG(*YES) could be:
